            <h3 class="menu-items">Esspresso</h3>
            <p class="white">The only ingredients you need to make espresso are finely ground coffee beans and hot
                water. The water
                should be heated to between 195 and 205 degrees Fahrenheit. The coffee beans should be ground to a fine
                powder, about the consistency of table salt.</p>
            <ul class="white">
                <li>Coffee beans: Espresso is typically made with dark roast coffee beans. Dark roast beans have a
                    higher
                    concentration of oils and soluble solids, which gives espresso its characteristic flavor and crema.
                </li>
                <li>Water: The water used to make espresso should be filtered and free of impurities. Impure water can
                    affect the taste of the espresso.</li>
                <li>Grind size: The grind size is important for espresso because it affects the extraction process. The
                    grind should be fine enough to allow the water to extract the flavors from the coffee beans, but not
                    so
                    fine that it clogs the portafilter.</li>
                <li>Tamping: Tamping is the process of compressing the coffee grounds in the portafilter. Tamping helps
                    to
                    ensure that the coffee grounds are evenly distributed and that the water extracts the flavors
                    evenly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="menu-items">Cappuccino</h3>
            <p class="white">The espresso is made in a coffee machine, and the milk is steamed in a milk frother. The
                steamed milk is then poured over the espresso, and the optional cinnamon or cocoa powder is sprinkled on
                top.</p>
            <ul class="white">
                <li>Espresso coffee beans: You can use any type of espresso coffee beans, but a dark roast will give you
                    the best flavor.</li>
                <li>Espresso machine: You will need an espresso machine to make the espresso. If you don't have an
                    espresso machine, you can use a stovetop espresso maker or a Nespresso machine.
                <li>Milk frother: You will need a milk frother to steam the milk. You can use a manual milk frother or
                    an electric milk frother.
                <li>Whole milk: Whole milk will give you the best results, but you can also use 2% or skim milk.</li>
                <li>Cinnamon or cocoa powder (optional): This is for garnishing the cappuccino.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="menu-items">Latte</h3>
            <p class="white">The exact proportions of espresso, steamed milk, and foamed milk can vary depending on the
                cafe and the barista's personal preference. However, the standard ratio is about 1:3:1, with 1 ounce of
                espresso, 3 ounces of steamed milk, and 1 ounce of foamed milk.
            <ul class="white">
                <li>Espresso: This is the base of the latte and gives it its strong coffee flavor. The amount of
                    espresso used will vary depending on the size of the latte, but it is typically about 1-2 ounces.
                </li>
                <li>Steamed milk: This is what gives the latte its creamy texture. The milk is heated to a temperature
                    of about 140-150 degrees Fahrenheit and then aerated with a steam wand to create microfoam.</li>
                <li>Foamed milk: This is the layer of foam that sits on top of the latte. It is made by aerating the
                    milk even more than for steamed milk, until it forms a light and airy texture.</li>
                <li>Optional flavors: Some cafes offer flavored lattes, such as vanilla, caramel, or chocolate. These
                    flavors are typically added to the milk before it is steamed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="menu-items">Dark Coffee</h3>
            <p class="white">
                Dark coffee is simply coffee that has been roasted for a longer period of time, giving it a darker color
                and stronger flavor. The ingredients of dark coffee are the same as those of any other type of coffee:
                roasted coffee beans and water.
            <p class="white">The roasting process is what gives coffee its flavor and aroma. When coffee beans are
                roasted, the
                sugars and acids in the beans caramelize, which produces the characteristic flavor of coffee. The longer
                the beans are roasted, the darker they become and the more intense their flavor becomes.</p>
            <p class="white">
                Dark coffee is often said to have a more bitter taste than other types of coffee. This is because the
                longer roasting process produces more of the compounds that give coffee its bitterness. However, dark
                coffee can also have a more complex and nuanced flavor than other types of coffee.
            </p>
            <ul class="white">
                <li>Coffee beans: Dark roast coffee beans</li>
                <li>Water:Filtered or bottled water</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="menu-items">Turkish Coffee</h3>
            <ul class="white">
                <li>Water: Cold filtered water is best for Turkish coffee. The water should be between 160 and 180
                    degrees Fahrenheit (71 and 82 degrees Celsius).</li>
                <li>Turkish coffee: Turkish coffee is made with finely ground coffee beans. The grind size should be
                    similar to that of powdered sugar. You can grind your own beans or buy pre-ground Turkish coffee.
                </li>
                <li>Sugar: Sugar is optional, but it is a traditional ingredient in Turkish coffee. The amount of sugar
                    you add will depend on your personal preference.</li>
                <li>Spices: Some people like to add spices to their Turkish coffee, such as cardamom, cinnamon, or
                    nutmeg.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="white">Turkish coffee is a delicious and traditional coffee drink that is enjoyed all over the
                world. It is known for its strong flavor and thick foam. If you are looking for a new way to enjoy
                coffee, I encourage you to try Turkish coffee.</p>
